## **Overview**

This repository is designed for developers to deploy a fully customizable store on an Evernode instance using Docker. You can fork this repo, customize your store, and deploy it seamlessly.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following tools installed locally:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (Package manager)
- GitHub account for repository management

Additionally, you need the following API keys and accounts:

- [Coinbase Commerce API Key](https://beta.commerce.coinbase.com/) (For payment processing)
- [Coinbase Developer Platform OnchainKit API Key](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/onchainkit)

---

## **Repository Setup**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
   cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

---

## **Environment Variables**

You need to set up the following environment variables in a `.env` file or through Docker secrets:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY=YOUR_COINBASE_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=YOUR_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=https://YOUR_CUSTOM_STORE_URL
```

Create this file in the project root or set these as Docker secrets if deploying securely.

---

## **Enabling Checkout**

By default, the checkout functionality is disabled to prevent transactions in non-production environments. To enable the checkout flow for local development:

1. Uncomment the relevant code in the `OnchainStoreCart.tsx` component.
2. Remove the `OnchainStoreModal` component and logic as well as the `MockCheckoutButton`. These are for demo purposes only.
3. Replace the placeholder `products` in the `OnchainStoreProvider` with your own product items.

Refer to the [Checkout Documentation](https://onchainkit.xyz/checkout/checkout) for more details.

---

## **Docker Deployment**

1. Build the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker build -t your-dockerhub-username/basechain-evernode-commerce-kit:latest .
   ```

2. Push the image to Docker Hub:

   ```bash
   docker push your-dockerhub-username/basechain-evernode-commerce-kit:latest
   ```

3. Run the container locally for testing:

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
     --name basechain-evernode-commerce-kit \
     -e NEXT_PUBLIC_COINBASE_COMMERCE_API_KEY=YOUR_COINBASE_API_KEY \
     -e NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=YOUR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID \
     -e NEXT_PUBLIC_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY=YOUR_ONCHAINKIT_API_KEY \
     -e NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=https://YOUR_CUSTOM_STORE_URL \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     your-dockerhub-username/basechain-evernode-commerce-kit:latest
   ```

---

## **Evernode Deployment**

1. **Login to Docker Hub:**

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

2. **Submit Docker Image to Evernode Host:**

   - Open an Evernode web interface from the list of live test hosts:
     - [https://evernode1.zerp.network/](https://evernode1.zerp.network/) (x4)
     - [https://takeme1.runonevernode.cloud/](https://takeme1.runonevernode.cloud/) (x2)
     - [https://x1.buildonevernode.cloud/](https://x1.buildonevernode.cloud/) (x28)
     - [https://snitznode1.snitzcreek.my/](https://snitznode1.snitzcreek.my/) (x8)

     **Note:** These hosts are for testing purposes only and are subject to updates.

   - Select an empty `Instance` section.

   - Add the Docker Hub image URL in the following format:
     ```
     your-dockerhub-username/basechain-evernode-commerce-kit:latest
     ```

   - Enter any required moments for testing deployment. Example: If your instance pricing is `0.1 EVR/hour` and you choose `2 moments`, you'll need to pay `0.2 EVR`.

3. **Monitor Deployment:**

   - Allow time for the Evernode host to update and deploy your Docker image.
   - Monitor the deployment logs for progress.

---

## **Testing and Verification**

1. Visit the store at the specified Evernode domain.
2. Verify that the pages load correctly.
3. Ensure API connections work by simulating transactions.
4. Check logs using:
   ```bash
   docker service logs basechain-evernode-commerce-kit
   ```

---

## **Security Best Practices**

- **Use Docker Secrets:** Protect sensitive environment variables by setting them as Docker secrets.
- **Avoid Hardcoding Keys:** Ensure API keys are managed securely using environment variables or secrets.
- **Restrict Access:** Limit access to deployment environments and ensure role-based permissions.

---

## **Support and Contributions**

We welcome contributions! Feel free to submit issues, pull requests, or suggestions.

If you encounter deployment issues, check:

- Docker logs
- Evernode deployment logs
- Environment variable correctness

Happy deploying!
